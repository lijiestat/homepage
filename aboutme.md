My name is Jie Li. I am a fourth-year Phd Candidate in Tsinghua University and am fortunate to be advised by Professor Lijian Yang.


What else do you need?

### Education

-PhD (2017-now), Department of Statistics, Tsinghua University

-Bachelor (2013-2017), Department of Statistics, Beijing Normal University

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer  your questions.
